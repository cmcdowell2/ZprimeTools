---Changes for Inclusive Samples---

Added function called Inclusive(int include, float genHT) to ZprimeJetClass_MC*.C that originally needed to be editted when doing inclusive samples
Inclusive(int include, float genHT) returns true when include=0 and genHT < 100 when include=1
Inclusize() is used at #L262 in ZprimeJetsClass_MC_ZJets.C
The variable include was added to respective ZprimeJetClass_MC*.h Loop functions so that it could be passed from argv[5] in the main() functions
MakeCondorFiles.csh was editted to use ${9} as the include variable
Logic was added to make it so if ${9} was not determined, include would be set to 0 so that everything would work with commands already in submit*.sh
Example of properly submitting inclusive sample:
./rootcom ZprimeJetsClass_MC analyze1
./MakeCondorFiles.csh analyze /hdfs/store/user/uhussain/Zprime_Ntuples_Aug10/DYJetsToLL_M-50_TuneCUETP8M1_13TeV-madgraphMLM-pythia8/crab_DYJetsToLL/170810_152817/0000/ postDY_MLM_0.root -1 10000 DYMLM_0 PU_Central.root 1

(note the last system argument is 1, which is the value given to the variable include)

Inclusive samples were added at the end of submit.sh for ease of use

---Changes to stack_plotter.C---

Added function called GetTotal(std::vector<TFile*> Files) to retrieve event count data from a list of files
GetTotal(std::vector<TFile*> Files) returns a vector of float values to be used as the total counts for scaling 
(counts are taken from h_cutflow->GetBinContent(1) from each respective file)
A vector is defined to have all the file names for a sample type
This vector is used to fill another vector with files
The vector that contains the files is given to GetTotal() and returns another vector with the total counts for each file
The definition for the j1EtaWidth histograms was altered to accomodate the new places the files are stored
Scale factors were altered to use the vector with the total counts instead of preset values

These changes were made to every instance a sample type was used even if there was only 1 file being opened
